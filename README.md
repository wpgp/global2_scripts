# Spatio-temporal harmonisation of global covariates
The code provided here was used to support the production of a global collection of spatio-temporally harmonised covariates as part of the WorldPop Global Demographic Data project and is associated with the paper ‘Global gridded multi-temporal datasets to support human population distribution modelling’ (link to follow).

Scripts are provided for production of layers of topography/slope (MERIT), precipitation (TerraClimate), temperature (Terra MODIS LST), built settlement layers (GHS), roads/building footprints, (Microsoft & Google), nighttime lights (VIIRS), landcover (ESA CCI), and protected areas (WDPA).

Program code is implemented primarily as windows batch script files using GDAL and other open source software and is based on the scripts of previous covariate production activities (Sorichetta, Alessandro; Lloyd, Christopher T. (2018). Global Spatio-temporally Harmonised Datasets for Producing High-resolution Population Denominators. figshare. Software. https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7291250.v1)

Funding: This work is part of the WorldPop Global Demographic Data project enabled through funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), grant number INV-045237.
